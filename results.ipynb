On the other hand, Assistant B provided a response that was both accurate and relevant, identifying the occupations of both Ian Hunter and Rob Thomas as singer-songwriters with additional roles in their respective bands. As a result, Assistant B's response is noticeably superior. \\n\\nTherefore, the final verdict is: [[B]].

However, the information given by Assistant B is incorrect. It was Sunil Grover, not Upasana Singh, who portrayed the character 'Gutthi'. Also, 'Carry On Jatta 2' is a 2018 film, not 2016.
