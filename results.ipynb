According to the additional information I found, James Tully was a member of the Australian House of Representatives for the Division of Barton, not Bourke. Therefore, Assistant A provided incorrect information and didn't fully answer the user's question.

Based on these factors and considering the criteria for this evaluation -helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, and depth- Assistant B's response is more accurate and relevant to the user's question and therefore better. \\n\\nFinal Verdict: [[B]]      B                     Y                   Y                     Y                   Y                   Y                 Y                     Y                   Y                   Y                 Y\n",
