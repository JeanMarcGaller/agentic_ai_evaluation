      "pairwise_reasoning": "Comparing both responses, Assistant A accurately states that the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 winner could not be determined at the current time because it is a future event. Whereas, Assistant B provides incorrect information. The assistant fictitiously announces Austria as the winner with a specific song and provides false references implying that Austria will host the 70th Eurovision Song Contest. This information is wrong as these events are yet to happen. Hence, in terms of helpfulness, correctness, and relevance, Assistant A's response is superior. While Assistant B attempted to exhibit depth with detailed information and references, the false nature of the details discredits this aspect of the response. In light of these observations, Assistant A provided a more reliable and correct response. \nSo, [[A]] is the better assistant.",
