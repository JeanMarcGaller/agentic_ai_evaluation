The submission can be deemed helpful if it provides relevant, insightful, and appropriate information to the person posing the question. \n\nLooking at the given submission, the respondent does the following:\n\n1. The respondent demonstrates an understanding of the question being asked, which is about an American YouTube personality who has appeared on Shane and Friends and runs two active YouTube channels.\n  \n2. The respondent provides examples of potential guests to which the query might be referring, such as Grace Helbig and h3h3Productions. This shows that the respondent has some knowledge about the subject, which makes the response insightful.\n  \n3. However, the respondent is unable to give a specific answer to the question due to a lack of information. The respondent politely asks for further details to provide a more accurate answer.\n\nEven though the respondent didn't provide the exact number of views which the input requested, they did provide an appropriate response to the context given their limitations (lack of specific information about the YouTube personality being referred to). The respondent attempted to assist by providing possible answers and is seemingly open to continue the conversation once they have more information. \n\nGiven these observations, the submission can be considered helpful.\n  \nTaking all these points into account, I say:\n\nY",

      "pairwise_reasoning": "Assistant A's answer is missing and thus provides no helpful information to the user's query. On the other hand, Assistant B appropriately makes clear that more information is needed in order to answer accurately. The response is correct and relevant, however, it lacks depth and creative help as it only asks the user for more information instead of trying to provide tentative answers based on popular Shane and Friends' guests. Nonetheless, Assistant B at least provides some sort of response in comparison to Assistant A. The winner in this case is clearly [[B]].",
