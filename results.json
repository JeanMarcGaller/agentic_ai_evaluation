    "question": "In which theater did Heidi Brunner, a Swiss opera singer, play the role as Annio? ",
    "responder_answer": "Heidi Brunner (b. 1970) is a Swiss mezzo-soprano celebrated for her portrayals of \u201cpants\u201d roles in Mozart and bel canto repertoire. Among these, her Annio in Mozart\u2019s La clemenza di Tito has figured prominently on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. In the mid-to-late 1990s she debuted the role of Annio at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve in a production directed by Robert Carsen, with Fabio Luisi on the podium. This staging was noted for its elegant Baroque set design and Brunner\u2019s warm, flexible timbre, which critics praised for capturing Annio\u2019s youthful ardor and dramatic loyalty. \n\nBrunner\u2019s performance at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve opened new doors in her career; it led to invitations to appear as Dorabella at the Komische Oper Berlin and as Sesto at the Frankfurt Opera. While her career has taken her to major houses including Opernhaus Z\u00fcrich, Teatro Real Madrid, and the Wiener Volksoper, it was Geneva\u2019s production that first brought her Annio to international attention. \n\nIn addition to her Mozartian work, Brunner\u2019s discography includes Handel oratorios (notably the title role in Deborah) and French m\u00e9lodie with lieder recitals in Zurich and Lucerne. Today she remains in demand both as a concert soloist and on the operatic stage, but it was at the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve that she first embodied Annio, combining technical precision and vibrant stage presence.",

    "question": "Baraki Barak District is situated in the western part of a province whose capital is what?",
    "responder_answer": "Baraki Barak District is one of the administrative districts of Afghanistan\u2019s Logar Province. It occupies the western portion of the province, bordering Kabul Province to the north and Wardak Province to the west. The district is predominantly rural, with agriculture\u2014especially wheat and vegetable cultivation\u2014and livestock herding forming the backbone of the local economy. Baraki Barak itself serves as the district center and is connected by secondary roads to the provincial capital and to Kabul, roughly 50 kilometers to the north.\n\nLogar Province, in which Baraki Barak District is located, has Pul-i-Alam (also transliterated as Pul-e-Alam) as its provincial capital. Pul-i-Alam sits at an elevation of approximately 1,905 meters above sea level and lies in a fertile valley irrigated by the Logar River. Serving as both the administrative and economic hub of Logar Province, Pul-i-Alam hosts provincial government offices, regional security headquarters, key market centers, and educational institutions.\n\nHistorically, the region around Pul-i-Alam and Baraki Barak has been significant due to its proximity to Kabul and its position along traditional trade and migration routes. In recent decades, efforts to improve infrastructure\u2014including road upgrades and irrigation projects\u2014have sought to strengthen the connectivity between Baraki Barak, Pul-i-Alam, and the national capital.

    "question": "What US city between New York and Quebec Canada was the most effected during the Taconic orogeny?",
    "responder_answer": "The Taconic orogeny (c. 480\u2013440 Ma) was a major mountain\u2010building event affecting the eastern margin of proto\u2013North America.  Between New York City and Quebec City, the U.S. city most directly overlying rocks deformed and uplifted by this orogeny is Burlington, Vermont.  Burlington sits on the western shore of Lake Champlain, within the Taconian belt where intensely folded metasedimentary and metavolcanic sequences\u2014originally shallow\u2010marine sediments and island\u2010arc volcanic rocks\u2014were thrust westward over the continental shelf.\n\nKey reasons Burlington was most affected:\n\u2022 Location on the Champlain Thrust:  Burlington is adjacent to one of the best\u2010preserved exposures of the Champlain Thrust Fault, a major Taconian structure where older, high\u2010grade metamorphic rocks were emplaced above younger slates and shales.\n\u2022 Meter\u2010scale folding and metamorphism:  In and around Burlington, Ordovician limestones, shales, and greenstones exhibit strong slaty cleavage, tight isoclinal folds, and contact metamorphism\u2014all hallmarks of Taconic deformation.\n\u2022 Proximity to high\u2010relief terranes:  Although present\u2010day topography is subdued, the core of the Taconics nearby once formed peaks perhaps exceeding 3,000\u20134,000 m, exerting direct influence on Burlington\u2019s substrate.\n\nBy contrast, New York City lies south of the main Taconian thrust belt, and Quebec City sits north of the U.S. border outside the core zone.  Burlington therefore represents the urban center most built atop the roots of the Taconic orogeny.",
    "revisor_answer": "Burlington, Vermont, is the U.S. city between New York City and Quebec City most severely underlain by Taconic orogeny structures. It lies at the western terminus of the 200 mi Champlain Thrust Fault, which transported Cambrian Dunham Dolostone westward ~30\u201350 mi over Middle Ordovician slates with ~8,850 ft of vertical displacement [1,2]. At the Lone Rock Point exposure, tight isoclinal folds, slaty cleavage, and localized upper greenschist\u2013amphibolite facies metamorphism record the roots of Taconic collision directly beneath the city [3].

    "question": "Stoke Extinguisher is what type of musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP?",
    "responder_answer": "Stoke Extinguisher is an EP, or \u201cExtended Play\u201d record\u2014a musical release that contains more tracks than a single (which typically features one to two songs) but is not lengthy enough to qualify as a full-length album or LP (Long Play). Historically, EPs occupy the space between singles and albums, usually spanning three to six tracks and lasting from approximately 10 to 30 minutes. Originating in the 1950s with vinyl formats (often as 7-inch discs played at 45 RPM with multiple songs per side), the EP evolved into a key promotional and artistic medium.\n\nIn rock, punk and indie circles, EPs have frequently been used to introduce new bands, experiment with different styles, or bridge gaps between major releases. They often serve as \u201cmini-albums,\u201d offering fans a more substantial glimpse of an artist\u2019s direction without the commitment of a full LP. In the digital era, EPs remain popular on streaming platforms and digital stores, where they can be released more quickly and flexibly than traditional albums. Labels and artists leverage EPs to maintain audience engagement\u2014offering remixes, acoustic versions, or collaborative tracks.\n\nStoke Extinguisher\u2019s designation as an EP situates it within this lineage: it provides more content than a standalone single, yet intentionally stops short of an LP\u2019s breadth, allowing for focused thematic or stylistic exploration. The term \u201cEP\u201d thus communicates to listeners both the scope and intent of the release, positioning it as a concise but substantial artistic statement.",
    "revisor_answer": "Stoke Extinguisher is an EP (Extended Play) by punk band NOFX, released November 26, 2013 through Fat Wreck Chords [1]. Issued as a six-track CD and a two-track 7\" vinyl, it includes the new title song \u201cStoke Extinguisher,\u201d a cover of Tony Sly\u2019s \u201cThe Shortest Pier,\u201d and four b-sides from 2012 singles [1][2]. By definition, an EP contains more tracks than a single (typically one to two) but is shorter than a full-length album or LP, generally spanning three to six songs and running under 30 minutes [3]. This format enables artists to deliver substantial new material without committing to an album\u2019s length and production cycle.",

The first of these was Buffalo Castle (1976), followed by titles like The Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon, Adventures in the Northern Wilderness (aka Buffalo Castle II), and The Goblin\u2019s Den.  Each Solo Adventure is numbered in T&T\u2019s catalog and designed by St. Andre or other freelancers, enabling players to build \u201csagas\u201d of linked adventures.\n\nFor multi-player sessions, T&T supplemented its basic rulebooks with \u201csupplements\u201d or \u201cmodule books,\u201d but the term in broad use for any stand-alone scenario\u2014solo or group\u2014is still \u201cAdventure\u201d (often further specified as Solo Adventure or Extended Adventure).
