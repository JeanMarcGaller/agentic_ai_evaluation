Is the submission insightful? \nThe submission doesn't offer any additional insights. It's merely a statement of unawareness on the subject. \n\n3. Is the submission appropriate? \nDespite not providing an answer to the question, it is indeed appropriate given it is a direct response to the input, and it's not giving misleading or false information. \n\nSo, overall, while the submission may be deemed appropriate, it doesn't satisfy the requirements of being helpful or insightful.

        "reasoning": "Step 1: Assessing \"Helpfulness\"\nThe submission doesn't provide any immediate answers to the question. Instead of providing a day of the week, the respondent says they're \"not aware\" of the show asked about. Therefore, the submission isn't helpful.\n\nStep 2: Assessing \"Insightfulness\"\nThere's no real insight offered in the submission either. The response lacks any deeper understanding of the question or related topic. So, it's not insightful.\n\nStep 3: Assessing \"Appropriateness\"\nAppropriateness involves the response being relevant and suitable to the question at hand. While the response is formulated respectfully and immaterially to the question, it is not appropriate in the sense that it doesn't answer the initial question of what day the Korean cooking-variety program airs.\n\nAfter assessing all the criteria, the submission does not meet the required standard of helpfulness, insightfulness, and appropriateness.\nTherefore, the response is:\n\nN",
