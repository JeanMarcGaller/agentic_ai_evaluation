    "question": "This work of literature _______ , known by its Greek title Oedipus Tyrannus was argued by Sigmund Freud to be one of the greatest works of world literature in his 1928 article. ",
    "responder_answer": "The work of literature 'Oedipus Rex,' known by its Greek title *Oedipus Tyrannus*, was argued by Sigmund Freud to be one of the greatest works of world literature in his 1928 article. Freud referenced the play in his analysis of the Oedipus complex, linking it to universal psychological themes. The play, written by Sophocles around 429 BCE, is a cornerstone of Greek tragedy. The English title 'Oedipus Rex' (Latin for 'King Oedipus') is the most widely recognized translation of the Greek original. Freud\u2019s discussion of the work appears in his essay 'Dostoevsky and Parricide,' where he emphasizes its cultural and psychological significance. The play\u2019s exploration of fate, familial conflict, and self-discovery aligns with Freud\u2019s theories on human motivation and unconscious desires.",
    "revisor_answer": "The work of literature 'Oedipus Rex,' known by its Greek title *Oedipus Tyrannus*, was highlighted by Sigmund Freud in his analysis of the Oedipus complex, though the specific 1928 article title remains ambiguous in sources. Freud linked the play to universal psychological themes, arguing that its narrative of patricide and incest mirrored repressed human desires. The play, written by Sophocles (~429 BCE), is central to Greek tragedy, with 'Oedipus Rex' being the Latinized English title. While Freud\u2019s essay 'Dostoevsky and Parricide' (1928) is often cited in this context, the direct connection to *Oedipus Tyrannus* in this article is not explicitly detailed in available references. Instead, Freud\u2019s broader discussions of the play appear in works like *The Interpretation of Dreams* (1900), where he explores its symbolic resonance with the Oedipus complex. The play\u2019s themes of fate and self-discovery align with Freud\u2019s theories on unconscious motivations, though the exact focus of the 1928 article requires further verification.",
