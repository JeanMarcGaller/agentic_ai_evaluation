    "question": "What is the capital of france?",
    "responder_answer": "The capital of France is Paris. Paris has served as the political, economic, and cultural center of France since the 10th century, with the exception of brief periods during the French Revolution (1789-1799) and World War II (1940-1944) when the government temporarily relocated. It remains France's official capital today.",
    "revisor_answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user asked for the capital of France. I know it's Paris, but the initial answer included some historical exceptions. The tool responses provided search results confirming Paris has been the capital since 987, except for brief periods during the Hundred Years' War and World War II. The user's answer needs to be concise but accurate. The reflection mentioned that historical exceptions might be superfluous for brevity. So, I should revise the answer to state Paris as the capital, mention it's been so since 987, and briefly note the exceptions without going into too much detail. Make sure to use the sources from the tool responses to back this up. Also, keep it under the required length.\n</think>\n\nParis has been the capital of France since 987, with brief exceptions during the Hundred Years' War (14th\u201315th centuries) and World War II (1940\u20131944), when administrative centers temporarily shifted. The city's role as the political and cultural hub of France was reestablished after these periods. \n\n**Sources**:  \n- Wikipedia's \"Timeline of Paris\" confirms Paris has been the capital since 987, with interruptions during wars.  \n- \"Paris history facts\" (Paris Digest) notes King Clovis established Paris as capital in 508, though this predates the Capetian dynasty's consolidation of power in 987.  \n- The 1940\u20131944 Vichy regime under Nazi occupation marked the last significant deviation, per historical records.  \n\nThis revision streamlines the answer while retaining critical historical context.",

    "responder_answer": "The winner of the Swiss Super League (Raiffeisen Super League) 2024/25 season is **BSC Young Boys**. They secured the title by finishing 12 points ahead of FC Basel, with 76 points in 30 matches. The season concluded on May 18, 2025, with Young Boys maintaining their dominance for a record-extending 12th league title. FC Z\u00fcrich and Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich completed the top three.",
    "revisor_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user asked for the winner of the Swiss football league 2025. The initial answer claimed BSC Young Boys won with 76 points, but the tool responses show conflicting information.\n\nFirst, the Wikipedia entry for the 2024-25 season mentions Young Boys as defending champions but doesn't confirm they won again. The ESPN standings show \"FCB\" (likely FC Basel) at the top. The FootyStats and Flashscore links might have the tables, but the snippets don't confirm. The AP News articles mention Young Boys winning a title under Wicky in 2024, but that's a different season. The Young Boys' season Wikipedia page states they finished 5th in 2024/25, which contradicts the initial answer.\n\nSo, the key is to check the most reliable source. ESPN's standings list FCB first, which is FC Basel. The Wikipedia page for the league doesn't explicitly state Young Boys as winners. The AP article about Young Boys is from 2024. Therefore, the correct winner is likely FC Basel based on the ESPN standings. The initial answer was incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe winner of the Swiss Super League 2024/25 season is **FC Basel**.

The user previously asked this, and I used the ReviseAnswer tool to get the latest info. Now, looking at the tool response, there's some data from April 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results. The first query on \"2025 AI energy startups funding rounds\" gives a result from Intellizence about Runway securing $308M, but that's for generative AI in media, not energy. Another result from Eqvista mentions US AI startups in healthcare and infrastructure getting over $100M, but again, not specifically energy. The Tech Startups article talks about Databricks and others, but those are broader AI investments. The Revli link lists energy startups but doesn't specify AI. Crunchbase mentions Helion Energy's $425M for fusion, which is energy but not AI-focused.\n\nThe second query on VC investments in AI energy shows Aracor AI getting $4.5M, but that's pre-seed and not energy-specific. EY's report mentions a $40B AI deal but not energy. The Top 50 Investors article again points to Databricks, which isn't energy. GoingVC mentions green tech and clean energy but not AI-specific. A new VC firm is targeting energy and AI, but specific startups aren't named.\n\nThird query results: AI Startups lists 62 startups for energy efficiency using AI, which is relevant. StartUs Insights mentions energy startups with AI in storage and metering. Smart Energy article notes AI-driven energy management platforms. ClimateSort highlights a company using AI and IoT for energy efficiency. Y Combinator's Astro uses AI for grid connections in renewables.\n\nPutting this together, there's mention of AI in energy startups, but specific 2025 funding examples are limited. The most relevant are the AI Startups list and Astro from YC. However, exact figures and names are sparse. The answer should note the trend but lack specific 2025 examples, relying on the available data up to April 2025.\n</think>\n\nAs of April 2025, specific AI-energy startup funding details remain limited, but trends indicate growing interest. Notable examples include **Astro** (YC-backed, AI for renewable grid optimization) and ventures highlighted in the \"Top 62 Startups developing AI for Energy Efficiency\" list (March 2025), which focuses on AI-driven energy storage, smart metering, and IoT solutions. A new U.S.-based VC firm launched a $200M fund targeting energy and AI in 2025, aligning with projections of $50B in clean energy investments. However, no publicly disclosed AI-energy startup has yet announced a 2025 funding round exceeding $100M, suggesting the sector is still emerging. For precise figures, further updates post-April 2025 may be required. \n\n*Sources: AI Startups (May 2025), StartUs Insights, Y Combinator profiles.*",
