    "question": "Which American sketch comedy television series starring John C. Reilly was produced by Abso Lutely Productions?",
    "responder_answer": "John C. Reilly starred in the sketch comedy series 'Enlisted,' which was produced by Abso Lutely Productions. The show, which aired on Comedy Central in 2014, combined live-action and animation in its sketches. Reilly co-created the series with David Wain and contributed to its writing and voice acting. Abso Lutely, known for producing 'The Office' and 'Parks and Recreation,' supported the show's absurdist humor and ensemble cast. 'Enlisted' ran for two seasons but was not as widely recognized as the studio's other projects. Reilly's role in the series aligns with his broader career in comedy, including films like 'Step Brothers' and 'The Anchorman' series.",
    "revisor_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user asked which American sketch comedy series starring John C. Reilly was produced by Abso Lutely Productions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the search results provided. The first query was about John C. Reilly and Abso Lutely. The results mention \"Enlisted\" but also other shows like \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" and \"Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule.\" However, \"Enlisted\" is noted as being produced by 20th Century Fox Television, not Abso Lutely. \n\nLooking at the second query about \"Enlisted\" production company, the Wikipedia and IMDb entries confirm that the production company is 20th Century Fox Television. So \"Enlisted\" isn't the right answer here.\n\nThe third query about Abso Lutely and John C. Reilly's shows points to \"Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule,\" which is a spin-off of \"Tim and Eric,\" produced by Abso Lutely. John C. Reilly stars in that show as Dr. Steve Brule. \n\nSo the correct answer should be \"Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule.\" The initial answer mentioned \"Enlisted,\" which was a mistake because the production companies don't match. The user needs to know that the correct show is \"Check It Out!\" produced by Abso Lutely.\n</think>\n\nThe American sketch comedy series starring John C. Reilly produced by Abso Lutely Productions is **\"Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule\"**. This show, which premiered on Adult Swim in 2010, is a spin-off of *Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!* and features Reilly as the eccentric public-access TV host Dr. Steve Brule. Abso Lutely Productions, co-founded by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, is explicitly credited as the producer in multiple sources, including Wikipedia and the show\u2019s official descriptions. Earlier claims about *Enlisted* are incorrect, as that sitcom (2014) was produced by 20th Century Fox Television. Reilly\u2019s role in *Check It Out!* aligns with his collaborations on absurdist, character-driven comedy. \n\n<references>\n- [Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_It_Out!_with_Dr._Steve_Brule)\n- [Abso Lutely Productions About Page](https://absolutelyproductions.com/about/)\n</references>",
