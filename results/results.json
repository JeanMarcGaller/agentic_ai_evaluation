      "pairwise_reasoning": "Assistant A and Assistant B both gave detailed responses. Each assistant mentioned different synthesizers announced by Moog Music Inc. in 2025, with Assistant A mentioning the \"Moog Mirror\" and Assistant B referencing the \"Moog Messenger\". Both answers seem to be helpful in answering the user's question and provide a good amount of detail.\n\nHowever, Assistant B included references for its answer. The references add credibility to the answer and provide the user with places to verify the information or learn more about the synthesizer. Therefore, Assistant B's answer has an edge in terms of correctness and depth.\n\nFinally, I cannot verify which answer is factually correct because the question and answers are placed in the future context. Assistant A or B might be correct, or they might both be inaccurate. But based on the details provided in the answers, I find Assistant B's response to be more helpful and in-depth.\n\nSo, I would conclude that Assistant B provided a better response to the user's question.
