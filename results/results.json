    "question": "Han Chae-young was in the 2009 drama that aired on what network?",
    "responder_answer": "Han Chae-young starred in the 2009 South Korean drama \"Boys Before Flowers,\" which aired on KBS2 (Korea Broadcasting System). The drama, part of KBS's 'School' series, became a global phenomenon and solidified her status as a leading actress. It followed the lives of high school students and their romantic entanglements. The network, KBS2, is one of South Korea's major public broadcasters. The series ran from March to December 2009.",
    "revisor_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking about Han Chae-young's 2009 drama and which network it aired on. From the initial answer, it was stated as KBS2 with the drama \"Boys Before Flowers.\" The tool responses need to be checked for confirmation.\n\nFirst, looking at the search results for \"Han Chae-young 2009 drama network,\" the MyDramaList entry mentions she was in a 2009 drama with 25 episodes, but the title isn't clear. The Wikipedia page for Han Chae-young lists \"Boys Over Flowers\" as part of her filmography. The blog post from kdramalive.com confirms \"Boys Over Flowers\" as a 2009 series.\n\nNext, the \"Boys Before Flowers broadcast network\" query shows multiple sources indicating it aired on KBS2. The Blogger post and DramaWiki both state KBS2 as the network. The Wikipedia entry for the drama also mentions KBS2. \n\nThe third query about KBS2's 2009 schedule lists \"Boys Over Flowers\" under KBS2's Mon-Tue slot in 2009. MyDramaList's KBS2 list includes the show with the correct dates. \n\nSo, all sources confirm the drama is \"Boys Over Flowers\" (also called \"Boys Before Flowers\") on KBS2. The initial answer was correct, so no revision is needed. The references should include the confirmed sources like the drama's Wikipedia, MyDramaList, and the specific KBS2 schedule entries.\n</think>\n\nThe 2009 drama featuring Han Chae-young, *Boys Over Flowers* (Korean: *Kkotboda Namja*), aired on **KBS2** (Korea Broadcasting System). This is confirmed by multiple sources, including the drama\u2019s Wikipedia page, MyDramaList, and KBS2-specific schedules from 2009, which list the show\u2019s broadcast period (January\u2013March 2009) and network. The title is sometimes translated as *Boys Before Flowers* or *Boys Over Flowers*, but all references consistently attribute it to KBS2.\n\n<references>\n1.

      "pairwise_reasoning": "Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate information regarding Han Chae-young's role in the 2009 drama \"Boys Over Flowers\" and its airing on KBS2. However, there are notable differences in their responses.\n\nAssistant A gives a straightforward answer, mentioning the drama and the network, but lacks additional context or detail about the airing period. This makes the response somewhat less informative.\n\nAssistant B, on the other hand, not only confirms the same information but also includes the specific airing dates (January to March 2009) and provides sources for further verification. This additional detail enhances the depth and helpfulness of the response, making it more informative and relevant to the user's question.\n\nIn terms of helpfulness, relevance, correctness, and depth, Assistant B clearly outperforms Assistant A by providing a more comprehensive answer.\n\nFinal verdict: [[B]]",
