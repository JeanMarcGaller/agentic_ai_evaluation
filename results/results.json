    "question": "Are Steve Perry and Leslie West both singers?",
    "responder_answer": "Steve Perry is an American singer, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Journey, recognized for his distinctive voice in hits like 'Don't Stop Believin''. Leslie West was an American musician, primarily known as a guitarist for bands like Mountain and Cream. While he occasionally contributed backing vocals and performed lead vocals in some tracks, he was predominantly recognized as a guitarist. Thus, Perry is primarily a singer, while West's primary role was as a guitarist with supplementary vocal contributions.",
    "revisor_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question: Are Steve Perry and Leslie West both singers?\n\nFirst, I know Steve Perry is the lead singer of Journey, so he's definitely a singer. Now, Leslie West is a bit trickier. From what I remember, he was a guitarist, especially with the band Mountain. But the user is asking if he's also a singer. \n\nLooking at the search results for \"Leslie West primary musical role,\" the Wikipedia page mentions he was a guitarist and frontman for Mountain. The Vintage Guitar article also calls him a \"guitarist/frontman.\" So his primary role was as a guitarist. \n\nNext, checking \"Leslie West vocal contributions in bands,\" some sources say he contributed backing vocals and did some lead vocals, like in \"Mississippi Queen.\" The Mabumbe article mentions he was a \"vocalist,\" and the Goldmine Magazine article notes his \"enthusiastic vocal\" in a song. So while he wasn't a lead singer primarily, he did sing occasionally.\n\nFor \"Steve Perry and Leslie West career roles,\" the results confirm Perry as a singer and West as a guitarist. The Wild West Show and his solo work also had him playing guitar, with vocals as a secondary role.\n\nPutting it all together: Steve Perry is a singer. Leslie West was primarily a guitarist but did contribute vocals in some tracks. So the answer is yes, both are singers, but West's primary role was as a guitarist.\n</think>\n\nSteve Perry is an American singer, best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Journey. Leslie West, primarily recognized as a guitarist for bands like Mountain and Cream, also contributed vocals in some tracks, including lead vocals on songs such as \"Mississippi Queen.\" While West's primary role was as a guitarist, he occasionally performed lead and backing vocals. Both Perry and West are singers, though Perry's career is exclusively as a vocalist, whereas West's singing was supplementary to his guitar work. \n\n<references>\n1.
